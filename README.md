# Cardley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fac19/Cardley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fac19/Cardley) 

[Cardley](https://objective-bell-c9fa55.netlify.app/) is a modern flash card app made for people who like to learn. It incorporates modern scientific findings on how people learn to help you learn effectively. 

There is a [sister repo for the Cardley API](https://github.com/fac19/Cardley---backend).

We have some sample users that you can use to play around with the site, and you can also create your own account.

## Local setup

To set up the frontend locally run the following commands in your terminal `git clone <front-end-repo-url>`, `cd`, `npm i`, `npm start`.
(frontend repo url: ```https://github.com/fac19/Cardley.git```)

(To run the tests on the front end, run `npm run test` instead of `npm start`).

One thing to be aware of is the backend URL. In the production repo the URL of the backend is live. To truly run the project locally (__strongly__ recommended for development):
1) run the API server locally by `git clone <back-end-repo-url>`, `cd`, `npm i`, `npm run dev`.
(backend repo url: ```https://github.com/fac19/Cardley---backend.git```)
2) SET UP TEST DATABASE? --follow instructions on backend readMe?
3) Make sure the backend is running on ```localhost:3001``` 
4) change the URL the frontend uses to access the API, found at `Cardley/src/utils/fetchData/backend-url.js` to

```javascript
// const url = 'https://cardley-api.herokuapp.com/';
const url = 'http://localhost:3001/';
export default url;
// make your choice
```

5) Set up a database as directed in the backend repo's readme

### Issue management
We use Github's issue tracker to track issues, and we assign labels for priority and estimates.

Priorities range from P1-P4, where P1 is the most urgent and P4 the least. Estimates start and E1 and go up, where a single E unit represents an hour of one person's time, or half an hour of pair-programming.

If you make an issue, you should give it E and P labels. When you complete an issue you should give it an A label, to indicate how long the issue actually took. A labels use the same scale as E labels.


### Linting rules

We use the Airbnb linting config, which is run with husky on commit. We ask that you don't `git commit --no-verify`.

### Use Material UI where possible

You can find the docs for Material UI components [here](https://material-ui.com/)

### React hooks

The project is written with React hooks in a largely functional style.
